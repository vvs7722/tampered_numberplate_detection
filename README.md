# Tampered Vehicle Number Plate Detection

This repository contains Python code for detecting tampered vehicle number plates using the Custom Vision service. The implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes various modules, including OpenCV (`cv2`), Matplotlib (`matplotlib`), NumPy (`numpy`), Imutils (`imutils`), EasyOCR (`easyocr`), and Requests (`requests`).

## Setup

1. **Python Installation:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Dependency Installation:** Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy imutils easyocr requests

Custom Vision Account: Create an account and set up a project on the Custom Vision service. Obtain the necessary API key and endpoint.

Configuration Update: Replace the placeholder values in the Jupyter Notebook (tampered_number_plate_detection.ipynb) with your actual API key and endpoint.
